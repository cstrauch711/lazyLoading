# lazyLoading
This program uses lazy loading to load a set of divs that can contain different data. As the user scrolls, more of these div elements will be loaded and rendered.
The program first creates an array of 250,000 pieces of test data and stores them. When the page is loaded, the initial 50 divs are loaded with their inner HTMl taken from the corresponding array index and rendered with the special-div class css style. The remaining divs are created with a return line and added to the page, but not rendered. As the user scrolls down, the function render() on line 59 is called to change the inner HTML of the div to the data from the corresponding index in the array and then rendered. Each scroll downwards fills and renders four divs at a time.
This program was created to hopefully be exteneded to include infinite scrolling for a different type of data to be rendered.
